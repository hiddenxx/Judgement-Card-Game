# Judgement-Card-Game
Judgment is a game where you have to predict the number of hands you'll make and try to make those number of hands that you predict.  It is a game usually for 3 or more players.  Even 2 players can play but then the game won't be that interesting.  5 players can play the game using one deck of 52 cards.  Jokers have no role here.
